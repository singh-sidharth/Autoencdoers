# Autoencdoers
Autoencoders are neural nets with a an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder goes to a bottleneck; then the decoder decodes it back into an image.

We have implemented 3 autoencoders here:
1. Without a fully connected layer
2. with fully connected layer
3. Variational Autoencoder

# Data
It has not been bundled but will download with the code. Else,
create ```data``` folder and put ```MNIST``` and ```FashionDataMNIST``` into the folder.
